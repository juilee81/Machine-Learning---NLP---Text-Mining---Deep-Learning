This project proposes a method to classify text into four different Emotion-Categories:   Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Joy. There is a target variable emotion which has four unique emotions. The approach is based on Machine Learning classification algorithms wherein we create a multi-label classifier and classify the tweets based on four categories. Hence, this is a supervised machine learning problem. We intend to explore the data by doing topic modeling. Apart from treating the corpus as a classification problem, analyzing hashtags and mentions can help us generate popular hashtags, topics and mentions associated with the particular emotion.
